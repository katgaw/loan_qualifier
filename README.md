* [pathlib](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/3.10/Lib/pathlib.py) -  Instantiates a concrete path for the platform the code is running on.

* [csv](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/3.10/Lib/csv.py) - Implements classes to read and write tabular data in CSV format. 
* [sys](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html) - This module provides access to some variables used or maintained by the interpreter and to functions that interact strongly with the interpreter.
